## Detailed Explanation of the CSC1035 Project
Start with this overview to set the stage.

"For my university's CSC1035 module, I participated in a team project to build a command-line quiz management system for Newcastle University College. The goal was to provide a functional back-end system that a head teacher could use to help students with exam revision. The project's requirements were quite specific, which gave us a great opportunity to apply core software engineering principles."

# Key Discussion Points

1. Database Integration and Hibernate
"A core requirement was to use a database to persist all the quiz questions and results. My team and I used Hibernate to follow the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern for manipulating the database. This was a critical choice because it allowed us to work with Java objects, like Question and Quiz objects, without having to write complex SQL statements for every operation. This is much more maintainable and robust."

2. Object-Oriented Design & Interfaces
"The client required a system that could be expanded later, so we focused on a strong object-oriented design using Interfaces. For example, we defined an IQuizService interface to outline the core functionalities, such as creating and managing quizzes. This loose coupling means we could have a different implementation for a web or graphical user interface in the future, just as the client requested. It shows that we were thinking about scalability and future-proofing the system."

3. Data Structures and Algorithms
"The client needed the ability to randomly generate quizzes of varying lengths and to filter questions by topic or type. To handle this, we made effective use of the Java Collections Framework. For example, when generating a quiz, we would first query all relevant questions from the database and store them in a list. Then, we used a shuffling algorithm to pick a random subset of questions to meet the quiz length requirement. This ensured the quizzes were always unique and well-balanced."

4. Teamwork and Software Engineering Principles
"This was a team project, so we had to work together on a single codebase. We used a standard Git workflow, with pull requests and code reviews, to ensure the code was robust and that every team member contributed effectively. My personal responsibility was to implement the core data access layer for the quiz results and to ensure that we correctly logged the user's performance for future review."

# Final Summary Statement

"Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in building a full-featured back-end system from a client specification. It taught me how to use tools like Hibernate for efficient data management, and the importance of good design patterns for creating scalable and maintainable applications. I believe these skills are directly transferable to developing high-volume, reliable applications in the fintech and payments industry."
