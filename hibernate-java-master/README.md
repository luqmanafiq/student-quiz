      - User can specify size, topic, and incorrectly answered questions only
    - Report
      - Report on any quiz done in the past
      - Allow user to specify all questions, just incorrect questions, just correct questions

## Database Structure
- Question Table
  - QuestionType (string)
  - ID (int) (automatic + unique)
  - QuestionString (string)
  - AnswerString (string)
  - MaximumMark (int)
  - Topic (string)
    - Stored initially as String in Question table, but can be changed to be a separate table for normalisation
- Mark table
  - Quiz
  - Username
  - DateTime
    - Recorded when the entire quiz finishes
    - Two quizzes cannot be submitted at the samee time by the same user
    - Is a composite key with Username and Quiz
  - Question
    - Foreign Key to ID in Question table 
  - Mark
- Quiz table
  - NameOfQuiz
  - Username (user that made the quiz)
- QuizQuestion
  - Quiz
  - Question
  - Order (int)  

FooterNote:
Essay-style questions can be added in the future via displaying the answer to the user and asking them to self-mark, but as of right now, Single Answer and Multiple Choice Questions are the priority.

### suggested Database Modification
tblQuiz
-    UserID (Auto Number) (foreign key)
-    QuizID (primary key) (Number)
-    QuizName (String)
     Explanation: Quizzes can be created by multiple users so the userID needs to be stored so that we can identify which quiz is related to which user. QuizID used to represent a quiz as the quiz name may be the same (user1 could have a quiz called science but so could user2 so the quizname canâ€™t be the primary key).

tblQuestion
-	QuestionID (Number) (Primary Key)
-	Question (String)
-	Answer (String)
-	MaximumMarks (Number)
-	QuestionType (String)
-	TopicName (foreign key) (String)
     Explanation: Stores the questions and answers for quizzes. QuestionID uniquely identifies a question, topicName is a foreign key to the tblTopic.

tblQuizQuestion
-    QuizID (foreign key) (Number)
-    QuestionID (foreign key) (Number)
-    QuestionIndex (Number)
     Explanation: Quiz question links a question to a specific quiz. Composite primary key created by the two foreign keys. Order is used to determine the index of the question in a quiz.

tblTopic
-    TopicName (String) (Primary key)
-    Topic Description (String)
     Explanation: Used to reference a topic (used in question table). Thought it should be in a separate class so that if someone was to alter a topic name, they could do so by altering this table only (not having to loop through all values in the question table).

tblUser
-    UsersName (String) (Primary key)
-    UserID (Auto Number) (Primary key)
     Explanation: Defines a user. Two users may share the same name so a UserID should be used to uniquely identify each user.

tblQuizSubmission
-    SubmissionID (Auto Number) (Primary key)
-    DateOfCompletion (Date/Time)
-    UserID (foreign key) (Number)
-    QuizID (foreign key) (Number)
     Explanation: Quiz Submission represents when a user submits a quiz. It has a submissionID field to identify the quizzes submission uniquely. The userID represents the user that took the quiz (QuizID) at the DateOfCompletion.

tblMark
-    submissionID (foreign key) (Number)
-    QuestionID (foreign key) (Number)
-    Score (number)
     Explanation: Stores the mark for each question submitted. Query can be made with the submissionID (representing the quiz submitted) to get all marks for questions taken in that quiz.


Other Suggestion:
tblQuestionStatement 
- Stores the QuestionID (foreign key)
- QuestionString (A question or question item if multiple choice)

To get all statements for the questions you would use the questionID of the question
 to query the database for all questionStatements for that questionsID (gets/ returns 
all the question statements as a list).

## Thoughts
We could use a keyword-searching system for marking longer answer questions
